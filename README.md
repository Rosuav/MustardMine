    The more work there is of mine, the less there is of yours.

TODO:

* Connect to Twitch API and update:
  - Stream title
  - Game category
  - Communities
* Connect to Twitter and send a tweet as you go live
* Connect to Discord?
* Retain history of previously-used title/cat/community sets
* Negotiate with StreamLabs extension for schedule??
  - Which direction? Configure SL or query it?
