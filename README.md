Mustard-Mine - Twitch Go-Live assistant
=======================================

    The more work there is of mine, the less there is of yours.

Source code for https://mustard-mine.herokuapp.com/ and also available for
individual deployment as desired.

TODO:

* Connect to Discord?
* Query StreamLabs extension for schedule?
  - Would require assistance from SL, which they don't currently offer
  - Reverse-engineering is impractical; needs an API.
* Create one database transaction per incoming HTTP request, for efficiency
  - Currently all operations that *require* atomicity are done with single
    calls to database.py (and single transactions within that), but the
    landing page has a ton of separate (read-only) queries.
* Work on styling... lots.
* Support chat integrations? Have reserved the Twitch username MustardMine
  for this purpose.
  - Maybe after sending a scheduled tweet, format a message for chat with
    the link? Could be handy for a few channels.
    - The link itself is available inside send_tweet() but isn't currently
      used anywhere.
* Get someone on a Mac to test things in Safari
  - The <dialog> tag isn't officially supported. Is my monkeypatch enough?
  - What should the Twitter MLE react to for "send now"? Ctrl-Enter okay?
* Can it be made so mods can be given permission to select a pre-built
  setup? Editors get full access (including seeing MM's own configs).
* Prepopulate new accounts with some examples, including several in the same
  category, to show how this would be useful
