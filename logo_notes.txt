The Mustard Mine logo
---------------------

Basic concept: Minecart on tracks coming out of a mine tunnel, bracketed by the
words "Mustard" and "Mine". The minecart contains mustard ore - yellow material
(not shiny like gold) with no obvious texture.

The general flow of movement is from top left to bottom right.

The cart ought to be made of wood, and be on not-too-shiny metal wheels. It
wants to be large and well-filled ("the more there is of mine", yada yada).
The tracks are metal (no wooden roller coaster rails here thank you!).

Should the letters be neatly bracketed by the sleepers?

What - if anything - should fill the space top right and bottom left?

The words should flow smoothly as if they were a single coherent unit. Might
make a good starting-point for the squetch. I mean sketch.

Mine tunnel opening top left? No tunnel opening (scene is outside)? Entire
piece is inside the mine? If inside (partially or entirely), is the tunnel
shored or just rock? Prob easier to be all outside.

Logo now exists, but I'm not bothering to put it onto this project. It's on
[the other Mustard Mine](https://mustardmine.com) instead.
