<h1>Mustard Mine</h1>
<p>
The Mustard Mine is a Twitch go-live assistant. It can set your game/category, stream title, and tags;
schedule a tweet to be posted right as you go live; provide a countdown timer for use in OBS or other streaming
software; and help you manage a checklist of important tasks. Mustard Mine will remember your "stream setups"
(category, title, tags, and launch tweet), allowing you to easily select between different setups as you
prepare for different types of streams - great when you have a varied schedule.
</p>
<p>
To get started, log in with your Twitch credentials. Don't worry; Mustard Mine never sees your actual Twitch
password.
